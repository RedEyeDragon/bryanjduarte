    Bryan attended the 2014 Clinton Global Initiative to represent QwikEyes as an invited participant. Prior to the conference 20 student ventures were invited to host an exhibit during the exhibition dinner where QwikEyes was presented to thousands of individuals including former president Clinton, his family, and media outlets. During the conference a live video recorded interview was conducted on Bryan regarding QwikEyes and what benefits the service has to its market.

    In addition to the Clinton Global Initiative QwikEyes was competitively selected to receive $6,000 in seed funding, mentorship, and other resources to assist in the startup of the business.
